# Even or Odd Number Checker

## Description
This Python program asks the user for a number between 1 and 100, then checks whether the entered number is **EVEN** or **ODD**. The program provides feedback if the number is outside the valid range.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to input a number between 1 and 100.
- It checks if the number is within the valid range.
- If the number is **even**, it will display: 
    - `"Your number {user_number} is EVEN."`
- If the number is **odd**, it will display:
    - `"Your number {user_number} is ODD."`
- If the number is outside the valid range, it will display:
    - `"Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 100."`
